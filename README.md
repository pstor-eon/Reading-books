# &#128218; read a book (Reading books record repository)

- There's still so much I don't know and so much to learn. So I decided to read a book this time. I thought it would be meaningless if I didn't organize after reading a book, so I decided to organize it together. I hope I can read a book and know a lot of things. There are so many things I don't know that I'm in trouble.
